# novel-downloader

This is a Python script that enables users to download a range of chapters from a novel as a PDF. It uses the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape the web and FPDF library to generate a PDF file. The user enters the title of the novel, and the program searches for it on allnovelfull.net. Once the program locates the novel, it displays the available chapters and prompts the user to select the range of chapters they want to download. Finally, the program generates a PDF file with the selected chapters and saves it to the working directory.
